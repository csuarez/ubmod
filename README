UBMoD - Metrics on Demand
========================================================================

UBMoD is an open source data warehouse and web portal for mining
statistical data from resource managers (TORQUE, OpenPBS and Sun Grid
Engine currently supported) commonly found in high-performance computing
environments. It was originally developed by Andrew Bruno at the Center
for Computational Research at the University at Buffalo, SUNY.

UBMoD is still under active development and should be considered alpha.
