UBMoD - Metrics on Demand - SGE Notes
===============================================================================

SGE does not report the nodes used by a given job in the accounting log.
For accurate node counts the accounting_summary must be set to FALSE in
sge_pe.  If accounting_summary is set to TRUE it will appear that all
jobs were run on a single node.

Unlike PBS/TORQUE, SGE does not have native log rotating.  If you're
logs are not rotated, it is necessary to truncate the `event` and
`sge_event` tables before shredding the accounting logs.  Otherwise,
duplicate data will be present in UBMoD.

The ubmod-shredder -d/--dir option was designed to work with the
accounting log naming convention used by PBS/TORQUE.  If you are not
using the same convention (files are named YYYYMMDD corresponding to the
current date), do not use this option.
