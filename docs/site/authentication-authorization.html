    <div class="heading">Authentication and Authorization</div>
    <p>This document will attempt to outline the authentication and
    authorization features currently available.
    <strong>UBMoD 2.0 (0.2.4)</strong> is the first version to integrate
    authentication and authorization features. <strong>Note: These features
    are not yet finalized and future versions may not be backward compatibile.
    </strong></p>
    <div class="heading">Authentication</div>
    <p>UBMoD does not provide any method for authenticating users (usernames
    and passwords are not stored in UBMoD), but can integrate with external
    authentication systems. Any of the Apache authentication modules should
    work with UBMoD.</p>
    <p><strong>Implementation note:</strong> Refer to the
    <a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs/2.2/howto/auth.html">Apache authentication and authorization</a>
    documentation for instructions on setting up authentication.</p>
    <p>The first step is to enable authentication system in UBMoD. Once
    enabled, you will no longer be able to access the UBMoD portal without
    being authenticated.</p>
    <p>Add this section to <code>settings.ini</code>:</p>
<pre>
[authentication]
enabled = true
</pre>
    <p>After enabling authentication in UBMoD, you must enable an Apache
    authentication module to provide the authentication mechanism required by
    UBMoD</p>
    <p>For example, to use basic file based authentication (mod_auth_basic and
    mod_authn_file):</p>
<pre>
&lt;VirtualHost *&gt;
    ...

    &lt;Directory /usr/share/ubmod/html&gt;
        AuthType basic
        AuthName "UBMoD"
        AuthBasicProvider file
        AuthUserFile /etc/htpasswdfile
        Require valid-user

        ...
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;
</pre>
    <p><strong>Implementation note:</strong> Refer to
    <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/features.http-auth.php">HTTP authentication with PHP</a>
    and the
    <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/reserved.variables.server.php">$_SERVER superglobal</a>
    documentation. By default, UBMoD uses REMOTE_USER as defined by the
    <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc3875">CGI/1.1 specification</a>.</p>
    <p>If you use an authentication system that doesn't set REMOTE_USER, but
    does set another header that is passed to PHP, that can be changed by
    setting the "key" setting:</p>
<pre>
[authentication]
enabled = true
key = CUSTOM_HEADER
</pre>
    <div class="heading">Authorization</div>
    <p>In addition to authentication, UBMoD has support for limiting access to
    specific users. This is accomplished by defining multiple roles and
    assigning a role to specific users. A default role may also be defined for
    users that haven't been assigned to a specific role.</p>
    <p>Before configuring authorization make sure that authentication is
    working properly. The authorization feature cannot be used without
    the authentication feature.</p>
<pre>
[authorization]
enabled = true
</pre>
    <div class="subhead">Resources and Actions</div>
    <p>Each role provides access to a set of resources and actions that can
    be performed on those resources.  Most of the resources and actions
    correspond directly to URLs with a few exceptions list in the next
    section.  The complete list of resources are defined in
    <code>acl-resources.json</code>. All the resources and actions have not
    been documented outside of the portal code, so it is best to make use of
    the pre-defined roles that are described later in this documentation.</p>
    <div class="subhead">Non-URL Based Resources and Actions</div>
    <p>In addition to the resources and actions that correspond directly to
    portal URLs, there are also other features that can be controlled with
    the authorization system.  Each page listed in the menu has a "menu"
    action. Denying access to the "menu" action of the "queue" resource will
    result in the absence of this menu item, but it won't prevent access to
    the queue page if accessed directly.  The "group" and "user" resources
    both have an action named "query-all". Denying access to these action
    will limit the users and groups to those that have the same name as the
    authenticated user's username and group, respectively.</p>
    <div class="subhead">Alternate Dashboards</div>
    <p>In addition to the standard dashboard, there are two other dashboards
    that only display group and user level information. To use the group
    dashboard for a given role, deny the "dashboard" "utilization" action (See
    the custom role section below).  To use the user dashboard, deny access to
    the "group" "details" action as well.</p>
    <div class="subhead">Pre-Defined Roles</div>
    <p>There are several roles defined by UBMoD that can be inherited from in
    custom roles. These roles are defined in a file named
    <code>acl-roles.json</code>. This file should not be changed. These roles
    correspond to each section of the UBMoD portal along with a
    <code>general</code> role that grants access to privileges that are needed
    by all users. These roles are not meant to be assigned directly to users,
    but can be combined to create custom roles.</p>
<pre>
general
dashboard-page
wait-time-page
wall-time-page
user-detail-page
group-detail-page
queue-detail-page
tag-management-page
tag-reports-page
about-page
</pre>
    <div class="subhead">Custom Roles</div>
    <p>Custom roles are defined in <code>roles.json</code>. Each role consists
    of a name with optional sections for parent roles, and resources that each
    role is allowed or denied access to.</p>
    <p><strong>Implementation note:</strong> All JSON files must be properly
    formatted. All strings must be enclosed in double-quotes and no trailing
    commas are allowed. Refer to
    <a href="http://www.json.org/">Introducing JSON</a> for more details.</p>
    <p>Example of <code>roles.json</code> format:</p>
<pre>
[
    {
        "name": "role-name-1",
        "parents": [
            "parent-role-1",
            "parent-role-2"
        ],
        "allow": {
            "resource-name-1": [
                "action-name-1",
                "action-name-2"
            ],
            "resource-name-2": null
        },
        "deny": {
            "resource-name-2": [
                "action-name-1"
            ]
        }
    }
]
</pre>
    <p>The file consists of an array of role objects.  Each role object has a
    name along with an optional array of parent roles, an optional object
    defining allowed resources and actions and an optional object defining
    denied resources and actions.</p>
    <p>The parent roles can be any role that is in the default role set listed
    above or a role that is defined in this file. This list should include the
    "general" role unless access to those resources is made available by
    another rule.</p>
    <p>The "allow" and "deny" objects can use any of the following three
    formats where <code>null</code> is used as a wildcard.</p>
    <p>Allow everything:</p>
<pre>
"allow": null
</pre>
    <p>Allow all actions for a resource:</p>
<pre>
"allow": {
    "resource-name": null
}
</pre>
    <p>Allow specific actions for a resource:</p>
<pre>
"allow": {
    "resource-name": ["action-name"]
}
</pre>
    <div class="subhead">Default Role</div>
    <p>If a role exists with the name <code>__default__</code> it will be used
    for authenticated users that aren't associated with any other role.  If
    you don't assign every user a role, it is suggested to create a restrictive
    default role that allow access </p>
    <p>Example with restrictive default role and admin role that allows
    everything:</p>
<pre>
[
    {
        "name": "__default__",
        "parents": [
            "general",
            "dashboard-page",
            "wait-time-page",
            "wall-time-page",
            "queue-detail-page",
            "about-page"
        ],
        "allow": {
            "user": null
        }
        "deny": {
            "dashboard": ["utilization"],
            "user": ["menu", "index", "query-all"]
        }
    },
    {
        "name": "admin",
        "allow": null
    }
]
</pre>
    <p><strong>Implementation note:</strong> Refer to the Zend
    Framework
    <a href="http://framework.zend.com/manual/1.12/en/zend.acl.html">Zend_Acl</a>
    documentation for precedence rules.</p>
    <div class="subhead">User Roles Assignment</div>
    <p>Users are assigned to roles in the <code>user-roles.json</code> file.
    Each user should be assigned only one role. If a user is assigned to more
    than one role, the behavior is undefined.
    </p>
<pre>
{
    "role-name-1": [
        "username-1",
        "username-2",
        "username-3"
    ],
    "role-name-2": [
        "username-4",
        "username-5",
        "username-6"
    ]
}
</pre>
    <p>This example assigns the <code>admin</code> role to three users.</p>
<pre>
{
    "admin": [
        "admin-username-1",
        "admin-username-2",
        "admin-username-3"
    ]
}
</pre>
