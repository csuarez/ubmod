    About UBMoD - University at Buffalo Metrics on Demand
  </div>
  <br/>
  <p>UBMoD is an open source data warehouse and web portal for mining
  statistical data from resource managers
  (<a href="http://www.clusterresources.com/pages/products/torque-resource-manager.php">Torque</a>
  and <a href="http://www.openpbs.org/">OpenPBS</a> currently supported)
  commonly found in high-performance computing environments. UBMoD presents
  resource utilization (CPU cycles consumed, total jobs, avg wait time, etc)
  for individual users, research groups, departments, and decanal units. A
  role-based authentication scheme is used to display data in the format best
  suited to the end-user (for example, as a student, research group leader,
  department chair, dean, etc.). The information can be presented in easy to
  understand interactive charts, graphs, and tables, with the added ability to
  display finer levels of detail. UBMoD is written in Java and uses MySQL as
  the backend database. The web portal runs inside a servlet container
  (Tomcat, Jetty) and can be viewed using any popular modern web browser that
  supports Javascript.
